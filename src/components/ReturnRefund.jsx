      <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>

      <h2>1. Return Policy</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Eligibility and Conditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers may return leased batteries and chargers at the end of their lease or upon early termination, as per the signed agreement and onboarding.</li>
        <li>Returns must be initiated within the time frame specified in your agreement, or within 15 days of delivery in case of defective or unsatisfactory products, in line with the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.</li>
        <li>To initiate a return, notify Urja Mobility via the app, website, or customer support at least 3 business days in advance.</li>
        <li>Returned items must be in good working condition, subject to normal wear and tear. Any damage, loss, or excessive wear will be assessed, and corresponding charges will be deducted from the security deposit and onboarding payment.</li>
        <li>For franchise partners, 50% of the one-time franchise fee (before GST) is refundable if all leased items (battery, charger, SOC meter, wiring harness) are returned in working condition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Early Termination and Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        If a customer withdraws before the minimum lock-in period (typically 24 months), all onboarding payments, deposits, or down payments are forfeited and non-refundable.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the lease period (usually 24-36 months), battery ownership may transfer to the driver, subject to fulfillment of all payment obligations, return conditions and a mutual understanding between the company’s management (lessor) and customer (lessee).
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Defective or Unsatisfactory Products</h3>
      <p>
        If you receive a defective, damaged, or unsatisfactory product, you are entitled to a return and full refund within 15 days of delivery, as mandated by Indian law.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such cases, Urja Mobility will arrange for free return shipping and process a refund within 7–15 days of receiving the returned product, as required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Security Deposits and Onboarding Payments</h3>
      <p>
        Security deposits and onboarding payments are refundable only upon successful return and inspection of all leased assets, minus deductions for damages, unpaid dues, or penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds are processed to the original payment method within 7–15 business days after asset inspection and verification, per legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Lease Payments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly lease payments, once paid, are non-refundable, even if the customer discontinues use before the end of the paid period.</li>
        <li>In case of order cancellation before delivery, any prepaid amount will not be refunded, as they will be used for administrative or delivery charges or both.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Forfeiture and Deboarding</h3>
      <p>
        If a customer defaults on monthly payments and fails to clear dues within the stipulated grace and recovery period, the battery will be deactivated and physically recovered. All onboarding and security deposits will be forfeited and are non-refundable.
